Q3:

Callbacks - Advantage: 

To explain one of the advantages of using callbacks, I'll use the example of the
setTimeout() function. With the help of callbacks, the user can create a timer that executes
a line of code every second. So you could create a timeout function that counts up
to 10 using this.

Callbacks - Disadvantage:

One disadvantage of callbacks would be that they are hard to read as 
there are lots of functions and brackets in a relatively small block of code.

Streams - Advantage:

Streams are easy to understand, which means that anyone with some level of experience
can easily create them.

Promises - Advantage:

The error handling is much better when using promises compared to using callbacks

Promises - Disadvantage:

Promises are slower than callbacks.

Q4:

CSS Box Model refers to rectangular boxes, which include their padding and margin, that are created for elements. Each box consists of an area where the content is located, which can be something like images or text. This can then be surrounded by padding, margins and borders.

To space out DOM elements, you can use padding which is used in the css box model. Examples of padding would be :
- padding-top
- padding-bottom
- padding-left
- padding-right

Q5:

In terms of how the browser loads the page, one of the first things that it does is load the HTML and CSS, as well as the JavaScript. This will create a page that has content on the screen (HTML), as well as a specific style for the content (CSS) and then the interactive elements (JavaScript).
