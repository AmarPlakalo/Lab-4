Q1: 

Props is just the shorter version of the word "properties". The role of props is to send data between components in reactjs.

State refers to an object that can allow components to create and manage their own data.


Q2:

A functor is used to map from one category to another.

Q3:

Callbacks - Advantage: 

To explain one of the advantages of using callbacks, I'll use the example of the
setTimeout() function. With the help of callbacks, the user can create a timer that executes
a line of code every second. So you could create a timeout function that counts up
to 10 using this.

Callbacks - Disadvantage:

One disadvantage of callbacks would be that they are hard to read as 
there are lots of functions and brackets in a relatively small block of code.

Streams - Advantage:

Streams are easy to understand, which means that anyone with some level of experience
can easily create them.

Promises - Advantage:

The error handling is much better when using promises compared to using callbacks

Promises - Disadvantage:

Promises are slower than callbacks.
