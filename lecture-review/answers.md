Q3:

Callbacks - Advantage: 

To explain one of the advantages of using callbacks, I'll use the example of the
setTimeout() function. With the help of callbacks, the user can create a timer that executes
a line of code every second. So you could create a timeout function that counts up
to 10 using this.

Callbacks - Disadvantage:

One disadvantage of callbacks would be that they are hard to read as 
there are lots of functions and brackets in a relatively small block of code.

Streams - Advantage:

Streams are easy to understand, which means that anyone with some level of experience
can easily create them.

Promises - Advantage:

The error handling is much better when using promises compared to using callbacks

Promises - Disadvantage:

Promises are slower than callbacks.

- padding-left
